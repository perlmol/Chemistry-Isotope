Chemistry::Isotope version 0.11
===============================

This module contains the exact mass data from the table of the isotopes.
It has an exportable function, isotope_mass, which returns the mass
of an atom in mass units given its mass number (A) and atomic number (Z); and
a function isotope_abundance which returns a table with the natural abundance
of the isotopes given an element symbol.

The table of the masses includes 2931 nuclides and is taken from
L<http://ie.lbl.gov/txt/awm95.txt> (G. Audi and A.H. Wapstra, Nucl. Phys. A595,
409, 1995)

The table of natural abundances includes 288 nuclides and is taken from
the Commission on Atomic Weights and Isotopic Abundances report for the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry in Isotopic Compositions of
the Elements 1989, Pure and Applied Chemistry, 1998, 70, 217.
